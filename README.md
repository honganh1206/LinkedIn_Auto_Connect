# LinkedIn_Auto_Connect
### A script that can help you auto connect with people on LinkedIn
A small description:
 * There are 2 options: Auto connect with people in "My Network" tab on LinkedIn/in an .xlsx (excel) file
 * When connecting with people in the .xlsx file, make sure that you have modified the script in accordance with your excel file (detailed instructions have been included within the script)

Some shortcomings:
* Sometimes the script cannot autoconnect with more than 10 people. Let me know if you encounter such shortcoming.
* The HTML structure of LinkedIn might be changed in the near future, so this is just for practice and consultation.
